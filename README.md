## 1.	What is data lake?
   ### a.   Data Lake:
   **i.**	A data lake is a central location that holds a large amount of data in its native or raw format.<br/>
   **ii.** It often consolidates all of an organization’s data in one single central location, where it can be saved “as is” without the need to impose a schema.<br/>
   **iii.** It stores data from all stages of refinement process starting from staging layer to compute layers.<br/>
   **iv.**  And, it can store all types of data – including unstructured and semi-structured data like image, video, audio etc.<br/>
   **v.**  Example – Azure genlake 2.<br/>

  ###  b.   Benefits of Data lake and how it’s different from Datawarehouse.
  **i.**  Datawarehouse can process only structured data whereas datalake can store structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.<br/>
      **Benefit for client:** They need not to maintain different types of databases for structured and unstructured data.<br/>
  **ii.**	Datawarehouse can scale up to certain extent and becomes exponentially more expensive but datalake can scale to any amount with less cost.<br/>
     **Benefit for client:** Scalability with low cost<br/>
 **iii.**	Data ware house is mostly meant for business professional but datalake can we used by business professionals and data scientist.<br/>
      **Benefit for client:** A unified space for everyone.<br/>
## 2.	What is serverless architecture? And what are pros and cons?
   ### a.	Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisions of server.
**a.** serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event triggered and are fully managed by event triggers.<br/>
**b.**	The pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre purchased compute capacity.<br/>
**c.**	Example: Azure functions, AWS Lambda.<br/>
**d.**	Pros: <br/>
 &nbsp; **i.**	Cheaper than traditional cloud<br/>
   **ii.**	It scalable to any capacity.<br/>
   **iii.**	It lowers human resource costs.<br/>
   **iv.**	It focuses more on user experience.<br/>
**e.**	Cons:<br/>
   **i.**	Third party has a control of the execution.<br/>
   **ii.**	It has learning curve.<br/>
